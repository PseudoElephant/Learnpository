# Machine Learning by Andrew Ng

## Introduction
Examples: 
- Database Mining
- Unprogramable application by hand (NLP, CV)
- Recomendation engines, customized


## Definition
- (Arthur Samuel) Give computer hability to learn without explicitely being programmed

- (Tom Mitchel) A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning

We are giving the right answer, or labels. (ex. Regressions or Classification)

## Unsupervised Learning

Unlabeled data, we want to find the structure (Clustering)

Ex. 

- Cocktail party problem
